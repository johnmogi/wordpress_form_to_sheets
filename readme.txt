Easily integrate and manage custom forms in WordPress, with options to store submissions in the database or send them to an external handler.

== Description ==
The Custom Form Plugin by John Mogi allows seamless integration of customizable forms into your WordPress site. Utilize shortcodes to display forms anywhere on your site. Configure submissions to be stored directly in your WordPress database or sent to an external URL for processing.

== Google AppScript Deployment ==
To ensure that form submissions from your WordPress site are properly handled and stored in a Google Sheet, you'll need to deploy a Google AppScript. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Google Sheet**:
   - Open [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new spreadsheet.
   - Set up the sheet with the following headers in the first row:
     ```
     date, customer-name, phone-number, source, email, message, אני מאשר/ת קבלת חומר שיווקי, נשלח מ, referer
     ```
     (Make sure these headers match the form fields used in your WordPress forms.)

2. **Open the Script Editor**:
   - In your Google Sheet, click on `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.

3. **Paste the AppScript Code**:
   - Copy the provided AppScript code below and paste it into the script editor:
     ```javascript
     [Insert the provided AppScript code here]
     ```
   - Save the script.

4. **Deploy the Script as a Web App**:
   - In the script editor, click on `Deploy` > `New deployment`.
   - Choose 'Web app' as the type, fill in the details, and deploy.
   - Copy the URL of the deployed web app. This will be your 'Submission Handler URL' in the WordPress plugin settings.

== Setting Up the Submission Handler URL in WordPress ==
After deploying the Google AppScript as a web app, follow these steps in your WordPress admin dashboard:

1. Navigate to the 'DMT Form Management' page.
2. Enter the URL of the deployed Google AppScript in the 'Submission Handler URL' field.
3. Click 'Save URL' to store your settings.

Your WordPress forms will now send data to the specified Google Sheet via the deployed AppScript.

Note: Always test your forms after setting up to ensure they are functioning correctly and data is being sent to your Google Sheet as expected.


== Installation ==
1. Upload `mogi-form-to-sheets-and-mail` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
