Correct, with the current structure of your plugin, individual form templates are placed in the `form-templates` directory, and each form template has its own file (like `sidebar-form.php`). Therefore, you don't need a separate `form-template.php` file unless it serves a specific purpose not covered by the individual form templates.

Before you proceed with the first implementation, here are a few considerations and best practices:

### 1. **Form Template Files**
   - Ensure you have created a PHP file for each form template within the `form-templates` directory. The file names should match the IDs used in the shortcodes.

### 2. **Form Submission Handling**
   - Decide how you'll handle form submissions. If you're storing submissions in the WordPress database, plan your database schema and how you'll insert the data.
   - If you're sending submissions to an external URL (like a Google Script), ensure that the URL is correctly set in the plugin's settings page and that the external handler is ready to receive and process the data.

### 3. **Validation and Sanitization**
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs both in JavaScript (client-side) and PHP (server-side) to protect against malicious data.

### 4. **AJAX Submissions**
   - If you plan to use AJAX for form submissions, enqueue and write the necessary JavaScript. Handle AJAX requests in your plugin and provide appropriate responses.

### 5. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test each form to ensure that it renders correctly, submits data as expected, and that the data handling (be it storage or transmission) works as intended.

### 6. **Security**
   - Use WordPress nonces for AJAX requests to protect against CSRF attacks.
   - Check user capabilities where appropriate, especially in admin functions.

### 7. **User Feedback**
   - Implement user-friendly notifications for form submissions, such as success messages or error alerts.

### 8. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure that your form templates are styled to be responsive and look good on all devices.

### 9. **Documentation**
   - Document how to use your plugin, especially how to add new forms and use shortcodes.

### 10. **Future Enhancements**
   - Plan for potential future enhancements, like more complex form management capabilities, analytics integrations, or additional customization options.

Once you've considered these aspects and implemented the necessary features, you should be ready to deploy your plugin for testing. This first implementation will give you valuable insights and may highlight areas for improvement or additional features.
