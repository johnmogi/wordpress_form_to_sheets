I apologize for any confusion. The code provided in the previous response sets up the foundation for creating and managing different forms, but it does not include the full implementation for creating forms via the WordPress admin panel. To allow the admin to create and manage forms, you'll need to add the necessary form creation and management functionalities. Here's an extended explanation of how to achieve this:

1. **Create Form Templates:** First, create individual form templates as separate PHP files inside the "form-templates" folder, as mentioned earlier. These templates will define the structure of each form.

2. **Admin Interface for Form Creation/Editing:** You should create an admin interface for form creation and editing. This interface should allow the admin to specify the form's fields, labels, and settings. You can achieve this by creating a WordPress admin page or using a custom post type for forms.

3. **Form Settings Storage:** Implement a way to store form settings and templates. You can use the WordPress options API to save form settings in the database. You can also save the form templates as separate files in your plugin directory.

4. **Render Forms Dynamically:** Modify the `custom_form_shortcode` function to dynamically render forms based on the settings provided in the admin interface. You can retrieve form settings and templates based on the form identifier passed in the shortcode and use that information to generate the HTML for the form.

5. **Form Submission Handling:** Implement the form submission handling logic, which should include data validation and processing. You can handle form submissions by creating a custom endpoint or using WordPress hooks like `admin_post`.

6. **Shortcode Usage:** Finally, the admin can use the shortcode with different form identifiers to display the desired forms on WordPress pages or posts.

Please note that the complete implementation of creating and managing forms in the WordPress admin panel can be complex and may require additional code and database storage. If you are not comfortable with PHP and WordPress development, it might be helpful to consult a developer or consider using an existing form builder plugin that provides similar functionality.
